# ðŸŽ¼ Composition Roadmap

This document outlines the structure and expectations for learning composition as a natural extension of musical fluency and creativity. Composition is not isolated from technique or repertoire â€” it grows from them. This roadmap introduces compositional thinking gradually, in parallel with playing and reading fluency.

---

## ðŸš§ Phase 1: Foundations of Composition

### Goals:

* Build comfort with musical structure through imitation
* Learn how melody, rhythm, and harmony work in simple forms

### Activities:

* Create short motives (2â€“4 measures)
* Rephrase or extend existing melodies (e.g. from repertoire)
* Write short 8-bar pieces using Iâ€“IVâ€“V chords in C or G major
* Build triads for I, IV, and V chords by stacking thirds from the scale
* Notate music by hand or with beginner-friendly software

### Skills Developed:

* Phrase structure (antecedent + consequent)
* Rhythmic balance and variety
* Chord function awareness (tonic, subdominant, dominant)
* Chord construction from scale degrees
* Reading and writing in treble or grand staff

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Expressive Writing and Form

### Goals:

* Develop musical ideas with intentional shape and expression
* Move beyond templates into original voice

### Activities:

* Compose 16â€“32 bar pieces with contrasting sections
* Use dynamics, articulation, and tempo markings in notation
* Create melodies over lead sheets or recorded chord progressions
* Try reharmonizing familiar tunes with alternate chord choices

### Skills Developed:

* Binary and ternary form understanding
* Motivic development and variation
* Stylistic awareness (e.g., hymn, folk, classical)
* Confidence writing and playing original music

## ðŸ§© Core Composition Projects

These projects provide a hands-on framework for developing the skills outlined above. Each is designed to reinforce musical understanding while building creative confidence.

### 1. **Motif Maker**

Compose three 2â€“4 measure motifs: one melodic, one rhythmic, one both. Use repetition and variation to make them feel complete.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Rhythmic balance and variety
* Motivic creation and variation
* Clear melodic contour in short phrases

### 2. **Phrase Builder**

Write an 8-bar piece using a simple chord progression (e.g. Iâ€“IVâ€“Vâ€“I in C major). Apply antecedentâ€“consequent phrasing.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Phrase structure (question and answer form)
* Chord function (tonic, subdominant, dominant)
* Grand staff writing and simple form awareness

### 3. **Melody over Harmony**

Create a 16-bar melody that fits over a provided chord progression (or one from your repertoire). Focus on contour and pacing. Include contrasting textures between the melody and harmony (e.g., broken chords, held notes, rhythmic offset) to explore balance between lines.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Harmonic alignment with melody
* Melodic pacing and phrasing
* Contrasting texture between melody and accompaniment
* Use of chord tones and passing tones

### 4. **Variation on a Hymn**

Choose a hymn from your repertoire and write a melodic variation using different rhythms or note shapes.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Motivic development through rhythm
* Creative reinterpretation within a tonal structure
* Understanding of style through variation

### 5. **Classical Miniature**

Compose a binary form (Aâ€“B) piece in either G or D major using articulation and dynamic markings. Minimum 16 bars.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Binary form structure (AB)
* Key signature fluency (G, D major)
* Dynamic contrast and articulation in notation

### 6. **Harmony Builder**

Compose an 8-bar melody using your own original chord progression. Begin with 3â€“4 chords and explore different orders or harmonic rhythms.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Chord progression creation and planning
* Voice leading awareness
* Harmonic rhythm and phrase pacing

### 7. **Ternary Miniature**

Compose a 24-bar piece in ternary form (ABA) using dynamics and articulation to distinguish sections.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Ternary (ABA) form structure
* Contrast and return in musical architecture
* Sectional expressive shaping

### 8. **Set a Lyric to Music**

Choose a simple poem, hymn verse, or original lyric. Compose a melody that fits the rhythm and natural emphasis of the text. This project introduces lyric writing gently in Level 1. If interest develops, it will be expanded in Level 2.

**Skills Reinforced:**

* Text setting and word stress alignment
* Melodic contour shaped by phrasing
* Interpretation and stylistic sensitivity

Composition develops gradually, alongside playing and listening. It rewards observation, experimentation, and personal reflection. The goal is not just to create, but to understand music more deeply through the act of making it.

# ðŸŽ¹ Core Repertoire Roadmap

This document outlines a learning progression using selected pieces that reinforce late Phase 1 and early Phase 2 objectives. It serves as the entry point into Level 2 by building confidence across foundational skills and gently expanding into new musical demands such as expressive phrasing, wider key familiarity, and classical repertoire. Hymns are ordered by increasing complexity and developmental value.

## 1. **Jesus Loves Me**

**Why First**: Simple melody and structure; perfect for entry-level reading and coordination.

**Focus Areas**:

* Fixed hand positions (Keyboard Fluency)
* Simple treble and bass clef reading (Music Reading)
* Gentle tempo and finger control (Technique)

**Skills**:

* Name and locate all keys used in the piece
* Play in a fixed 5-finger position without looking at hands
* Read and play RH melody from treble clef with 80% accuracy
* Play LH support notes with proper timing
* Maintain curved hand shape and even tone

---

## 2. **Amazing Grace**

**Why Second**: Recognizable melody with more dynamic motion and phrasing.

**Focus Areas**:

* Phrase shaping and rests (Technique)
* Right-hand melody with left-hand harmony (Keyboard Fluency)
* Intermediate rhythm patterns (Music Reading)

**Skills**:

* Read RH melody across a wider range of notes (C4â€“D5)
* Play LH accompaniment with Iâ€“IVâ€“V chord outlines
* Execute slurs and phrase breaks with control
* Maintain even rhythm through rests and syncopations
* Coordinate hands rhythmically in simple meter

---

## 3. **Softly and Tenderly**

**Why Third**: Introduces legato phrasing and expressive timing.

**Focus Areas**:

* Smooth transitions between fingers (Technique)
* Tied notes and longer phrases (Music Reading)
* RH fluid motion, LH support (Keyboard Fluency)

**Skills**:

* Sustain tied notes across barlines without breaking phrasing
* Perform legato transitions between 3 or more fingers
* Balance RH melody against softer LH accompaniment
* Interpret expressive markings (slurs, dynamics) if present
* Maintain slow, steady tempo without drifting

---

## 4. **What a Friend We Have in Jesus**

**Why Fourth**: Adds harmonic movement and rhythmic variation.

**Focus Areas**:

* LH chord progressions (Keyboard Fluency)
* Hand independence (Technique)
* Moderate rhythmic complexity (Music Reading)

**Skills**:

* Play broken or blocked LH chords with accurate timing
* Maintain RH melody while LH changes chords
* Read and perform dotted rhythms and syncopation
* Keep both hands in time despite rhythmic differences
* Control dynamic contrast between hands

---

## 5. **Be Still, My Soul**

**Why Fifth**: More expressive and harmonically rich; bridges into Phase 2 skills.

**Focus Areas**:

* Dynamic control and rubato (Technique)
* Cross-hand melodic development (Keyboard Fluency)
* Expressive reading and tempo flexibility (Music Reading)

**Skills**:

* Vary touch and tone to match phrasing dynamics
* Sustain melody while shifting hand positions fluidly
* Read across both clefs with rhythmic independence
* Interpret expressive tempo markings (e.g., rit., rubato)
* Perform at expressive tempo with musical shaping

---

## 6. **Minuet in G Major** *(attributed to J.S. Bach)*

**Why Sixth**: Introduces classical structure, expanded hand range, and scale-like movement; strengthens key familiarity beyond hymn repertoire.

**Focus Areas**:

* Two-hand coordination in extended passages (Technique)
* Note reading across full staff range (Music Reading)
* Finger agility and position shifting (Keyboard Fluency)

**Skills**:

* Navigate between treble and bass clef with quick reference
* Execute simple scale runs and crossovers cleanly
* Observe and perform basic classical phrasing
* Maintain hand independence with alternating activity
* Adjust dynamics for sectional contrast and repetition

---

## 7. **German Dance in D Major** *(Beethoven)*

**Why Seventh**: Expands into a new key signature (D major) with two sharps; combines classical articulation and light-handed expression.

**Focus Areas**:

* Key familiarity with sharps (Keyboard Fluency)
* Classical articulation and phrasing (Technique)
* Rhythmic balance and form (Music Reading)

**Skills**:

* Play in D major using accurate Fâ™¯ and Câ™¯ fingering patterns
* Navigate simple LH/RH alternation with clear articulation
* Apply staccato and slur markings in alternating phrases
* Maintain steady tempo across repeated forms
* Use light dynamics to match the dance character

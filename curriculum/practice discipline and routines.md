# üìö Practice Disciplines and Routines

This document defines the long-term learning behaviors and supporting habits that complement the skill and repertoire curriculum. These are not content goals, but **disciplines** that support confidence, retention, musical maturity, and long-term growth.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Core Disciplines

### 1. **Recording and Feedback**

* Record your playing at least once a week ‚Äî ideally full pieces or targeted sections
* Listen critically: assess timing, tone, control, and musicality
* Compare recordings over time to measure growth and identify regressions
* Store selected recordings as personal performance benchmarks
* Share select recordings with trusted teachers, peers, or communities for outside feedback
* Choose performances that represent your *current edge* ‚Äî not just polished work
* Treat external critique as fuel for focused refinement, not as judgment

### 2. **Deliberate Practice**

* Always practice with intention and awareness
* Focus on one small skill or passage at a time
* Use slow tempo to build accuracy, then speed up gradually

### 3. **Reinforcement & Review**

* Revisit older material weekly, even if "mastered"
* Rotate through previously learned pieces to maintain fluency
* Include warm-ups and short drills that revisit fundamentals

### 4. **Self-Evaluation**

* Record yourself and listen back regularly
* Take brief notes on mistakes and tension spots
* Reflect weekly: what is improving? what still needs focus?

### 5. **Memory Maintenance**

* Play memorized pieces weekly without reference
* Re-memorize segments if needed through chunked repetition
* Treat memory as an evolving, active skill

### 6. **Mindful Repetition**

* Repetition is good only if it is mindful, not mechanical
* Use variation (tempo, dynamics, articulation) to stay engaged
* Isolate common failure points and loop them with focus

## ‚è∞ Practice Routine Components

Each session (\~30‚Äì45 min) should flexibly draw from:

* **Warm-up (5‚Äì8 min)**: technique drills, scales, or 5-finger patterns
* **Skill Focus (10‚Äì15 min)**: isolated technical or reading work
* **Repertoire (10‚Äì20 min)**: learn, reinforce, or polish pieces
* **Reflection (2‚Äì5 min)**: quick mental or written check-in

## üìÜ Numbered Practice Cycle (5-Day Plan)

Use a rolling 5-day cycle that picks up where you last left off. This ensures momentum and structure without calendar pressure.

### Day 1: **Foundation Focus**

* Warm-up + technique
* Core skill work (e.g., rhythm, note reading)
* Play through or review a previously learned repertoire piece

### Day 2: **Composition Lab**

* Warm-up with motif or rhythmic exploration
* Work on a current composition project (new idea or refine existing)
* Short hands-on sketching or melody draft

### Day 3: **Repertoire Builder**

* Learn or refine a current repertoire piece
* Focus on 1‚Äì2 challenging measures with looping
* Reinforce one musical concept (e.g., phrasing, dynamics)

### Day 4: **Application & Review**

* Light run-through of a piece (repertoire or composition)
* Reflect on what's feeling stronger vs. weaker
* Optional: record a small section if ready and review

### Day 5: **Integration Day**

* One full warm-up routine
* Play through one composition + one repertoire piece
* Light written or verbal reflection: ‚ÄúWhat did I solidify this cycle?‚Äù

## üîÅ Skill Transfer and Retention

* Skill drills build reliability, but repertoire proves fluency
* When a piece is mastered with a target skill, that skill is considered "locked in"
* Maintaining repertoire keeps learned skills fresh without separate drilling
* If regression is noticed, revisit isolated practice temporarily, then re-integrate into musical context

These disciplines provide the behavioral backbone of the curriculum, supporting the development of skill into expressive, confident musicianship.

## ‚è≥ Estimated Timeline for Level 1 Completion

* **Minimum (focused approach)**: \~16 weeks (4 months)
* **Typical (balanced pace)**: \~20‚Äì24 weeks (5‚Äì6 months)
* **Deep learning (with review cycles)**: \~28‚Äì30 weeks (7 months)

This estimate reflects steady, 5-day/week practice using the numbered routine, with integrated progress across both the repertoire and composition roadmaps.

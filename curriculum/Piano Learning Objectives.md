# 🎹 Piano Learning Objectives

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Foundation

### 🔹 Introduction

This phase builds the essential skills needed to navigate the instrument, read music, and execute basic movements. The focus is on accuracy, consistency, and familiarity with the core mechanics of piano playing. Each practice session should include time for all three core areas: keyboard fluency, music reading, and technique — developing them in parallel to support steady, integrated progress.

---

### 1. **Keyboard Fluency**

* Identify all white keys on sight, without hesitation (<2 seconds per key)
* Play any named key (white or black) across the 61-key keyboard without looking
* Shift hand positions smoothly across at least 3 octaves
* Play octave jumps and name both notes correctly

### 2. **Music Reading**

* Read and name all notes from Bass F to Treble G without reference
* Sight-read 8 bars of a beginner piece with both hands (80% accuracy)
* Clap and count rhythms using whole, half, quarter, and eighth notes
* Recognize and play in at least 3 key signatures (C, G, F)

### 3. **Technique**

* Maintain curved hand posture and correct fingering in 5-finger patterns
* Play 5-finger warmups in C, G, and F major (hands together) with steady tempo
* Play 1-octave scales in C and G (hands separately) without error
* Transition smoothly between fingers 1-3-5 without tension

### 🔁 Reinforcement and Feedback

* Skills are revisited regularly through varied exercises, not learned once and forgotten
* Practice includes repetition of previously learned material to strengthen muscle memory and retention
* Regular self-review (listening back, comparing against KPIs) guides what to revisit
* Cross-cutting documents (e.g. practice logs, review weeks) will structure reinforcement loops across objectives

### 🧩 Transition to Phase 2

As foundational skills from Phase 1 become consistent, relevant aspects of Phase 2 may be introduced. This progression is fluid, not binary — early expressive work (like simple chord progressions or a first performance piece) can begin while core technique and reading continue to develop. Mastery emerges through overlap, not separation.

## 🎯 Phase 2: Mastery

### 🔹 Introduction

This phase shifts from raw mechanics to musical application. It is not a hard transition but a gradual shift in emphasis. Early in Phase 2, foundational skills will still be reinforced while new expressive skills are introduced incrementally. Elements of repertoire, harmony, and improvisation will be layered into the routine alongside continued reading and technique to ensure confidence grows steadily across both phases. With a functional grasp of the keyboard and notation, the focus now becomes expression, interpretation, creativity, and real-world musical skills like playing songs, improvising, and evaluating your own performance. Practice sessions in this phase will continue to rotate through all key skill areas — repertoire, harmony, composition, and self-evaluation — ensuring they grow together through experience and feedback.

### 4. **Repertoire**

* Maintain 3–5 pieces that can be played from memory or with minimal review
* Demonstrate dynamics, articulation, and phrasing in performance
* Perform selected repertoire at consistent tempo with both hands together

### 5. **Chords and Harmony**

* Play I–IV–V–I progressions in C, G, D, and F major fluently
* Identify and voice at least 12 common chords (major/minor/7th)
* Harmonize simple melodies with appropriate chord progressions

### 6. **Improvisation and Composition**

* Improvise 8–16 bars over I–IV–V or 12-bar blues progression
* Transcribe a short melody by ear and play it accurately
* Compose and notate at least one original piece (16 bars or more)

### 7. **Performance and Self-Evaluation**

* Record and self-evaluate at least one performance per month
* Perform two pieces in a home or recorded setting with confidence
* Maintain a progress journal with monthly goal reviews and notes

### 🔁 Reinforcement and Feedback

* Skills are revisited regularly through varied exercises, not learned once and forgotten
* Practice includes repetition of previously learned material to strengthen muscle memory and retention
* Regular self-review (listening back, comparing against KPIs) guides what to revisit
* Cross-cutting documents (e.g. practice logs, review weeks) will structure reinforcement loops across objectives

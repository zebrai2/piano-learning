# piano-learning
ðŸŽ¹ This repo documents my adult piano learning journey. It covers foundational skills, music reading, technique, and gradually builds toward repertoire, improvisation, and composition. Practice logs, recordings, and reflections are versioned for tracking progress and staying accountable over time.
